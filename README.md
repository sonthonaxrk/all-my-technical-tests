# List of Technical Tests I Have Done

In my career I have done a great number of technical tests. Some I merely did as exercises for myself knowing that I
was probably not going to get the job, and hoped to merely expand my skillset. I've obviously developed as a developer over
the years, but I'm pleased with most of the tests I have done.

However, at this point I hope that anyone who wishes to hire me will examine this first, before compelling me to add yet another example of Django, Flask or a simple algorithm.

## B2C2

This was a demonstration of how to build an ideal SDK for an API. This focused on lowering the barrier to entry using GUIs
embedded in Jupyter. And, I demonstrated how you can use MyPy with metaprogramming. I went quite in-depth trying to achieve
my desired result, and subsequently patched the IPython kernel to fix a major bug I found.

## London Contract 2021

This was a pretty simple CRON parser. But it demonstrated project structure and use of PyTest.

## London Contract 2021

Demonstrates the use of Cython and C++ to do a simple job.

## BCGDV 2019

Demonstration of building an RabbitMQ RPC based microservice on top of Nameko. Resises and rotates images in different processes
with S3 as shared memory. Ran in docker-compose.

## Zyper 2019

Demonstration of how I would set up a Django application for API usage. I find that many Django developers frequently add
too many batteries because they don't know what is integral or not. For instance, you probably do not need CSRF middleware
if you only have an API. This was a highly stripped down Django project, reducing cruft.

## Big Health 2018

Demonstration of a Flask application that tells you when to sleep. Not much to say. Used a Dockerfile, SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow.

## Growth Street 2017

Probably my worst technical test as I missed the point. I used this time to learn about Django Channels and Websockets.

## Streetlife Test 2015

Little algorithmic test that I solved with a graph search algorithm.
